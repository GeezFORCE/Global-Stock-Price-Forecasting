## To Get Started

### Environment Setup

- Install Anaconda Navigator , make sure to setup conda properly(with path).

- Create an new virtual environment
  `conda create -n <nameOfEnvironment> python=<version>`

- To activate an environment
  `activate <nameOfEnvironment>`

- To deactivate an environment
  `conda deactivate`

- To install a package, use pip or conda
  `pip install <packageName>`
  `conda install <packageName>`

- To list packages in environment
  `conda list`

### Install Packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setting Up Path for importing Modules (Optional)

- Goto `C:\Users\<your_username>\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages`
- Create a file `Python<versionNo>.pth` , eg: `Python37.pth` for Python 3.7
- Edit the file to include this line `C:\\Users\\<your_username>\\my_module`
- eg; If the Project is present in a folder named Project in Desktop of user A, the file should be `C:\\Users\\A\\Desktop\\Project`

### Setup for saving models

- In the project directory create a folder named `models`, `savedModelInformation`, `saveScaler`, `savedData`.
- The directory `savedModelInformation` must have sub-directories `modelInformation`, `modelWeights`.

### Setting Up Tensorboard

- In a seperate terminal, intialize the conda virtual environment created for the project.
- In the project directory create a new folder named `logs`
- Type the command `tensorboard --logdir=logs\`
- Open a browser window and paste `http://localhost:6006/`

### Changing requirements.txt

- Run `pip install pipreqs`
- Run `pipreqs <path> --force`

### Google Colab Implementation

[![Keras Tuner](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UqJFzvPrLxoE2AeeuRV-TytVdM0xNLU_?usp=sharing)

### Install NLTK for Finviz Sentimental Analysis

- Open a python console, type `python` or execute python interpreter
- Import the module , `import nltk`
- Download Vader using the command, `nltk.download("vader_lexicon")`

### To run UI

- Navigate to Project Folder
- Run the command `streamlit run app.py`
- Open `http://localhost:8501/`

### UI Tree

### Issues

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Values in constant not updating in other modules, probably need to scrap constants
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ Warning in new version of tensorflow, maybe bug
      WARNING:absl:Found untraced functions such as lstm_cell_1_layer_call_and_return_conditional_losses, lstm_cell_1_layer_call_fn, lstm_cell_2_layer_call_and_return_conditional_losses, lstm_cell_2_layer_call_fn, lstm_cell_1_layer_call_fn while saving (showing 5 of 10). These functions will not be directly callable after loading.

- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ Reduce complexity of the Currency Conversion (Optional)
- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ Warning - Sets are not currently considered sequences, but this may change in the future, so consider avoiding using them.

### Fixed

- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Scaler produces wrong values in inverse transform operation.~~
- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Downloads of data takes a long time, bulk download is highly complex~~
- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Model fails whenever TSLA is used~~
- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Colab NoneType Error~~
- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Both models cannot take into account the age of the companies~~
- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Alt model produces NaN on certain runs~~
- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Preprocess Output issue in Numpy~~
- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Error with LSTM network (may have caused by preprocess correction)~~
- [x] ~~ðŸ”´ Validation set is not scaling~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¡ https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy -- Scaler Warning~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¡ Find Hyperparameters to improve, look into various activation function, now using standard functions~~ -- Solved with keras tuner
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¡ Implement currency conversion for non-USD Stocks~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¡ Saving trainX, trainY, validationX, validationY (optional)~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¡ Prediction flattens in rare occurences (can be replicated with GOOG and AAPL).~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¡ Increasing the complexity of bidirectional LSTMs~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¡ Preprocessor cannot handle small datasets.~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¡ Preprocessor cannot handle validation set (5 percent resulted in error)~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¢ tensorflow 2.4.1 requires h5py~=2.10.0, but you have h5py 3.2.1 which is incompatible, change version when creating requirements.txt~~
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¢ Attributes for Plot Wrapper~~ -- Scrapped
- [x] ~~ðŸŸ¢ Complexity of datetime Conversion~~ -- Scrapped
